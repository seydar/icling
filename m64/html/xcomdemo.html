  OVERVIEW: 
    XCOM is a compile-and-go implementation of the X language.  
    If there is no implementation for the underlying hardware,
    the 'go' step will be INtel x86 emulation (slow).
    
    The form of the language is given in file X.cfg.  
    It is patterned after Dijkstra's language in 
    {\em A Discipline of Programming}.  
 
    The meaning of the language is largely conventional.  
    There are three types (logical, integer and real).  
    They map into true/false, 32 bit ints and IEEE 32bit floating point.  
    The type of constants is manifest in their form.
 
    The arguments to XCOM are strings.  
    If an argument is valid path name to an X source file (dot-x), 
    the file will be read; if the argument is a valid flag,
    it will be used to direct the next compilation; 
    otherwise the argument itself is taken as X source.  
  
    If xcom has more than one source input, 
    the last one is taken as the main program; the rest are subprograms. 
 
    The X language is strongly typed.  
    The type of variables is inferred from use.  
    It is possible to write an X program where the type cannot be inferred;
    XCOM will report an error.
 
    The final value of variables used only on the left of assignments in
    the main program will be reported as output.  
    The value of variables never used on the left in the main program 
    will require input prior to execution.
 
    X programs may call each other.  The subprogram inputs and outputs map 
    in order into arguments and returned values.  
    X programs can call C and/or M functions.
 
    The design focus for xcom is ease of understanding and extensibility.

##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% A Compiler Written in MATLAB
% * There is a compiler named xcom.
% * There is a traditional compiler theory course based on xcom.
% * The latest version is on the MATLAB File Exchange (# 20419).

%% Getting Started
% The file README.html in the mxcom directory gives a structured
% introduction to the compiler and course.

%% Running xcom
% Once you have the FX version unpacked into a directory
% you can compile and run a simple program in the X language:

xcom y:=1

%%
% The meaning of the X program 'y:=1' is 'assign integer 1 to variable y.
% Since the assignment is wasted (variable y is not subsequently used),
% xcom reports the final value of y as output.  The remaining details of
% the little language X are given in the X reference manual in the
% downloaded compiler+course.  X is intended as a minimal base language to
% which the compiler writing student will add whatever constructs are of
% interest.

%% xcom Flags
% The compiler comes with a comprehensive set of flags, mostly designed to
% produce intermediate output of the inner workings of xcom.  For instance,
% the Intel X86 machine language for a program can be dumped as follows

xcom -asmTrace y:=1

%%
% What you see is almost all prolog and epilog code
% (standard for any X program).  At byte 8 you can see the integer constant
% 1 being loaded into x86 register EAX, and at byte 13 you can see the move
% that puts the answer at offset 0 in the frame (where variable y is
% located).  Information about the flags can be see via the command

help xcom
