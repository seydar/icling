<H3>Symbol Tables and Type</H3>

<H4>Frames in xcom</H4>
<P>
A symbol table is a block of <B>name/attribute pairs</B>.<BR>
A runtime frame is a block of memory locations for <B>values</B>.<BR>
xcom makes one of each block for each X program (and subprogram).
</P>
<P>
The symbol table is built during <A HREF="Analysis.html">analysis</A>.
The <A HREF="Runtime.html">runtime</A> frame is 
allocated just before execution begins.
Just to keep things simple in xcom,
the entries in the two storage blocks correspond one-to-one.  
Suppose the variables are named <TT>B</TT>, <TT>I</TT> and <TT>R</TT>.

Actually, things are slightly more complicated.  
Temporary variables are allocated during code generation.
Places for them are tacked on to the end of the runtime frame
but there is no need to put them in the symbol table.

<H4>The Symbol Table</H4>
<P>
The symbol table is built by <B>walking the syntax tree</B>.  
As each variable is encountered at a leaf node,
it is looked up in the symbol table, and entered if not there.
When an operation is encountered, its type signature is used
to refine the types in the symbol table.
Here is a <A HREF="TypeInference.pdf">worked example</A>.
</P>
<P>
In a production compiler, 
symbol table lookup can be a performance bottleneck,
and is therefore normally uses a <B>hash-table</B> lookup.  
In xcom a simple linear lookup is used.
</P>

<H4>Scope</H4>
<P>
Many programming languages have a concept of scope.
A scope has a beginning and an end.
A variable can be seen in its scope and not otherwise.
Scopes often can be nested leading to rules resolving the interpretation 
of a single name occurring in more than one level of nesting.
</P>
<P>
In X there is one scope per subprogram.
All variables are local.  
Values are passed in and out via parameters.
Subprogram names (listed on the <B>xcom</B> command line) are global.
</P>

<H4>Symbol Attributes</H4>
<P>
Type and use information is gathered for each variable.  The information
comes from the syntax tree.  
A symbol table is constructed (it is initially empty).
The information in the tree does not change (read-only) but the
symbol table gradually acquires more information during type analysis.
</P>
<P>
The X language is <B>strongly typed</B>, 
meaning that all operations require type-correctness.
Some operations, such as '+', are <B>overloaded</B>;
real can be added to real and integer can be added to integer
but mixed type addition is not allowed.
<P>
</P>
The initial entry for a symbol necessarily records <B>all types</B>
as possible since nothing is yet known about the variable.
If the type of a variable has not yet been fully determined,
and a usage is found that requires a more specific set of types,
then the other possibilities are removed as attributes
for that variable in the table.
</P>

<P>In expression processing, a node (always representing an X operand)
may have a known type because of its use (for example, the expression
argument to <TT>r2i</TT> must have type real).  
This type requirement is carried down the tree as it is walked.
If there is an intact requirement when a variable is reached (at a leaf),
that requirement is recorded in the symbol table for that variable.
Subsequent references to that variable elsewhere in the tree use
the recorded information.  
Thus the type information hops from leaf to leaf as well as 
travelling up and down the branches.
</P>

<P>Suppose, for example, the subexpression is <B><TT>r2i(x+y)</TT></B>.
The node for the parameter is forced to type real.  
When the node for addition is reached, 
its result is forced to type real,
which forces both of its operands to type real.
When the leaves are reached, both are then also forced to type real
and the type is recorded in the symbol table for each of them.
The result of 
<B><TT>r2i(x+y)</TT></B> is forced to type integer and passed back
up the tree.
</P>
                      
<P>
If a <B>type conflict</B> is encountered (meaning that there are no
more remaining possibilities), 
or the type is still <B>not defined</B> 
after all information has been gathered,
a diagnostic is issued and <B>xcom</B> exits.
</P>

<P>
The use of the variable is also recorded.  
If the variable is on the left of assignment, the address is needed.
If it is used in an expression, the value is needed.
The names given to these properties are <B>left</B> and <B>right</B>.
A variable may have either or both such attributes.
</P>

<H4>Type Inference</H4>
<P>
Some type-determining situations do not give complete information.
In X these are the opportunities and what can be recorded,
based on the signatures of the <B>xcom</B>
<A HREF="ReferenceX.pdf">operators</A>.
The <EM>result</EM> types are passed root-ward; 
the <EM>operand</EM> types are passed leaf-ward.  
These are actions represent the inherited and synthesized attributes.
Knuth has written a nice <A HREF="AttributeGrammarHistory.pdf">history</A>
of how <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_grammar">
attribute grammars</A>
developed and eventually entered into the literature.

An <B>xcom</B> assignment insures the types of the left and right hand
sides of the assignment are the same.
But, if neither left nor right type is known at the moment of examination,
the correct type cannot be entered into the symbol table.  
It may be that, after walking the syntax tree once, 
some variables do not yet have fully defined types.
A sequence of assignments, 
each leaving the types equal but undefined, is the worst case.
</P>
<P>
The symbol table information is refined by additional 
<A HREF="Glossary.html#pass">pass</A>es
over the syntax tree 
extending the type-effect of an assignment one step at a time.  
The symbol table implementation, therefore, 
repeatedly walks the syntax tree until no further type changes are found.
Some small modifications of the depth-first tree walk are implemented
to improve the efficiency of type analysis.  More could be done.
</P>
<P>
Languages, such as C, 
with declare-before-use do not need multiple passes to 
build the symbol table because the type information is already
fully determined.
