<H4>Overview</H4>

<P>
Synthesis is the process of using the information gathered during Analysis
to extract the meaning (semantics) and construct an executable.  
In a typical compiler, an intermediate representation, or IR, 
holds the gathered information.  
In xcom the IR representing an X program consists of 
a syntax tree and associated symbol table.
Since several X programs may cooperate (all but one defining subprograms),
the synthesis algorithms need IR for <EM>all</EM> of the X programs 
before synthesizing the result.  
</P>

<P>The consequence is that the Analysis (often called the front-end) 
examines each input source program in order 
and constructs a sequence of IR representations, one for each program. 
This sequence is examined by the Synthesis (often called the back-end).
At any moment the Synthesis is principally concerned with the 
IR for one subprogram, but may refer to other IRs for cross-program linking.
