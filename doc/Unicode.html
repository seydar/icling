<H3>Unicode</H3>

<P>
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</A>, 
  or ISO 10464, is ASCII on steroids.  
  The objective is to be able represent, especially on the WWW, 
  all of the characters in use, or ever having been used.

</P>
<P>
  To get all the worlds languages into computers, 
  127 bit patterns are not enough.
  The Han (or CJK) languages by themselves take more than 50K patterns.  
  So there are three additional coding schemes, 
  one with 8 bit codes (UTF-8) 
  one with 16 bit codes (UTF-16) 
  and one with 32 bit codes (UTF-32).  
  UTF-8 and UTF-16 are variable length encodings.
  Each of the schemes can represent almost 
  2<SUP>32</SUP> unique characters.
  Unicode has directional control (Hebrew is right-to-left, for example),
  a collating sequence, a class for alphabetic letters (there
  are a lot of them), and many other representational features.
</P>
<P>
  This is a <B>big deal</B>.
  National governments negotiate over who gets what blocks of characters.  
  Unicode is the basis for browsers, Matlab, Java and XML among others.
<P>

<P>
  ISO 10464 defines the characters (called codepoints).
  One can see the <A HREF="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/iwi/charmap.html">
  glyphs</A> on various public websites.
  You can see some of the variety of characters in this Unicode

<P>
  Ken Thompson and Rob Pike proposed a trick to make ASCII
  a proper subset of Unicode.  It was accepted by ISO at UTF-8.  
  Integer values 1-127 are reservered for ASCII and 
  the rest of the codepoints are represented with more than one 8-bit byte.  
  Here is the scheme (UTF-8):

<P>
  This scheme provides some ability to resynch if there is a transmission
  error because internal bytes have the unique prefix 10 and can
  be skipped for awhile until a new character starts.  The agreement is
  to use the shortest code possible for each character.  Code 0 is
  reserved for end-of-string as in C.

  <A HREF=HTTP://www.unicode.org>Unicode home page</A> for details.

  IBM ICU</A> for software to support Unicode.
