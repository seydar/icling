<P><B>Kinds of Analysis</B></P>

<P>
When a text is written down there must be an agreement 
so that the readers understand the writers.  
The agreement includes the form and the meaning of what is written.
</P>

<P>
From the viewpoint of a compiler, a user program is a sequence of
characters; to the programmer it is a much richer entity.  The
compiler must inspect the input text, deduce the content intended by
the programmer, and synthesize a corresponding executable.
</P>

<P>
Programming language text has two levels of structure.  The first level
defines <B>symbols</B> analogous to the words and punctuation 
of natural language.
The second level defines <B>phrase structure</B>, 
relating nearby sequences of symbols.  
The phrase structure of natural language contains concepts
such as <I>subject</I>, <I>object</I> and <I>predicate</I>.  
The phase structure of an imperative programming language instead uses 
phrase names such <I>program</I>, <I>statement</I> and <I>expression</I>.
</P>

<P>
Once the shape of the program is determined, the compiler must find
the <B>meaning</B> of the symbols and their relations.  
Information about meaning can be inherent in the symbol (such as '+'), 
or provided explicitly by the programmer, for example, 
in the form of declarations.  
In X, the programmer-intended meaning of each non-reserved symbol 
is inferred from its use.
</P>

<P>
When the compiler cannot analyze its input, 
it issues a <B>diagnostic</B> to assist the programmer in making 
the input acceptable.  
Locating the exact <B>point of failure</B>
is part of the diagnostic process.
