After getting a <A HREF=InstallXcom.html>personal copy</A> of xcom:
<UL>

<LI>
<P>Try the xcom compiler:</P>
<P>
Bring up MATLAB and change directory to mxcom from the xcom distribution.  
At the prompt, type (no blanks internal to the assignment)
<PRE>
>> xcom x:=1
</PRE>
The result will be to compile the assignment into machine language and then 
run it.  You should see
<PRE>
x := 1
</PRE>
which is the correct result for the 4-character program presented to xcom.
</P>

<P>
For further information, type
<PRE>
>> help xcom
</PRE>
or read the <A HREF="ReferenceX.pdf">X Reference Manual</A>.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Look at these typeset <A HREF="ExampleX.pdf">examples</A> or this
bigger <A HREF="sinx.html">example</A>.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
In the mxcom x subdirectory, there is a set of X programs.
One of them computes &pi; by evaluating a series.
Run it.  xcom "knows" argument x/pi.x is a file name 
because it ends in '.x'. 
<PRE>
>> xcom x/pi.x
</PRE> 
The xcom runtime asks for the number of terms you want.
Try several runs with different settings.
</P>
<P>
Because the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)">
alternating harmonic series</A> converges so slowly,
you will not like the results for small settings.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Look at the mxcom x directory
<PRE>
>> ls x/*.x
</PRE>
Run a selection of the programs.
Some of the programs call each other and, in that case,
must <B>all</B> be named on the command line.  For example
<PRE>
>> xcom x/pi.x x/callpi.x
</PRE>
The last program named is the main program.  
Once it is in execution it can call the others,
and they can call each other, including the main program.
</P>
<P>
  With a critical eye, read the X source of each program you ran.
  Suggest <A HREF="xcomQE.html">changes</A> where appropriate.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Improve the accuracy of the program for &pi;.
The easiest solution is to present the average of the last two
results.
Depending on your prior knowledge and ambition, 
this exercise could take some research.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Use the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">
Taylor Series</A> to implement X functions for e(x), sin(x) and cos(x).
Use the previous program to compute &pi; to test your new functions.
Recall that <A HREF="sinx.html">sin(x)</A> 
is one of the implemented examples, in case you want to peek.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Implement and test an X function abs so that
<PRE>
   pos := abs := signed
</PRE>
gives the positive result for signed input.  What type do you 
want it work for?  Maybe you need two abs functions.
Could you have used it in the previous exercise?
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
Excuse the poor X pun, but carry out the following meta-program
<PRE>
do learning ? write(interesting program) 
od
</PRE>
</P>
</LI>

</UL>
