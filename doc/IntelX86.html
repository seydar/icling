<H4>Memory</H4>
<P>
Memory is addressed to the byte; it is 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</A>.
To avoid over-complicated explanations, suppose that there are
three different instructions to load a value from memory into a 32-bit
register
</P>
<BIG>
    <PRE>
        LOAD8  addr
        LOAD16 addr
        LOAD32 addr
    </PRE>
</BIG>
<P>
... and suppose the bytes of memory at addr contain 
</P>
<BIG>
    <PRE>
        123456789...
    </PRE>
</BIG>
... then the loaded register will contain
<BIG>
    <PRE>
        0001
        0021
        4321
    </PRE>
</BIG>
<P>
The consequence is that looking at a memory dump gives a different
byte order than looking at a register.  
It takes some getting used to and requires little-endian emitters
to put word-values into memory in the right order.

<P>
  The register names drip with history.  
  This general architecture started as a 4-bit machine,
  then grew to 8, 16, 32, and 64.  
  The x86 is the 32-bit stopover.
  There were previous names such as A, AH, AL, AX for what now
  is the EAX, or Extended Accumulator eXtended.  
  The old names are still used for various reasons,
  one of which is backward compatibility.
  What happens in the registers is 32-bit 2's complement arithmetic.
  What the values are used for is <B>integer arithmetic</B> 
  and <B>memory addressing</B>.
</P>
<P>
One can do a little research project to find out why EAX, EBX...
are not in alphabetical order.  And one can try to guess without
looking how the 32-bit names are extended again for the 64-bit CPU.
</P>

<P>
EIP is the <B>program counter</B>.  
It addresses 2<SUP>32</SUP> bytes of memory.
Instructions are variable length (1 byte to 10 or more).  
EIP is always pointing at the next thing to do.
It clicks on all by itself until a branch happens.
Branch addresses are normally self-relative.  
It is easy to make a mistake and be off by one.  
It is usually exciting to branch into the middle of some other instruction.
</P>

<H4>Accumulators</H4>

<P>
The registers 0-3 are used by <B>xcom</B> as accumulators.
EAX sometimes is "special," 
so the code generator has to dance around a bit while using it.
The registers 4-7 are even more "special."
</P>

<H4>Calling Sequence</H4>
<P> 
  Registers ESP and EBP (4,5) are used exclusively for 
  subroutine call and return.
  They contain the information for maintaining the hardware run stack.
  As it happens, the run stack 'grows' toward address zero
  so the 'top' of the stack is at the lowest address.
  ESP points at the top of the hardware run stack.  
  EBP points at the base of the current hardware stack frame.
</P>
<P>
  Each subroutine call needs a new frame.
  Memory beyond ESP is free to use, so (the old) EBP is
  pushed onto the stack and reset to ESP.  
  The new frame is then using free stack space.
  The called routine must then set ESP to point beyond the new stack frame, 
  again resuming is role in pointing to the next available memory.
</P>

<P>
    The state of the CPU has to be preserved across the calling sequence.
    The buzz-words are <B>caller save</B> and <B>callee save</B>.
    What they mean is either that the caller saves things it needs
    so that it can restore them after the call returns,
    or that the subroutine saves things immediately upon entry, 
    then restores them just before returning.
    There are advantages to both in avoiding unneccessary saves.
    In <B>xcom</B>, callee save/restore is implemented.
</P>
<H4>Data Pointers</H4>
<P>
Registers ESI and EDI (6,7) are normally used to deal with blocks of memory;
<B>xcom</B> hijacks ESI as a pointer to the (malloc-d) X frame.
</P>

<H4>Flags</H4>
<P>
The flag bits change every time the status changes, 
perhaps after every instruction.
The flag bits get set, for example, by comparison instructions.
The flag bit values have to be used "right away" to avoid clobbering them.
</P>
<P>
The flags used by <B>xcom</B> are CF, SF, ZF and PF meaning carry flag,
sign flag, zero flag and parity flag.
The zero flag ZF is 1, for instance, if the last result was zero.
</P>

<H4>Floating Point Unit</H4>
<P>
IEEE floating point computations are executed in the FPU.
It used to be a separate piece of hardware which had to communicate
off-chip with the instruction execution unit.  
The communication instructions are still used 
even though it is all on one chip now.
The FPU has eight 80-bit wide registers organized as a stack 
and 8 1-bit tags.  Tag value 1 means useful data is in the register.
The top of the FPS is always numbered R0. The FPS is accessed with 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish</A>
instructions.  Here is a picture with two numbers on the FPS.
<TABLE ALIGN="center" BORDER="1">

<TR><TD>R7</TD><TD></TD><TD>0</TD><TR>
</TABLE>
Both the significand and exponent carry more bits in the FPU than in memory.  
The FPU state can be set to ignore the extra significand bits,
but not the extra exponent bits.  FPS overflow discards the bottom value.
Don't cause it to happen.  
<B>xcom</B> in fact only uses two of the FPS stack entries.
</P>

<H4>FPU Status Word</H4>
<P>
Corresponding to the flags, there are status bits in the FPU.
They are needed for conditional branches. 
To get them into the flags, there are instructions that move
the FPU status bits into EAX, and then into the flags.
This is one of the places where EAX is "special".
</P>

<H4>Instructions</H4>
<P>
The Intel names for instructions are just a little too abstract
for direct use in the xcom assembler.  
It is important to know the addressing mode.
Thus there is an <B>xcom</B> convention shown in the following examples.
