<P>
  This compiler course is a work in progress.  
  It is usable now, but will undergo improvements for some time.
  It is my hope that users will communicate their desires and
  <A HREF="xcomQE.html">advice</A> to me.
  Here is a list of the known major work items.
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Port to Intel A64.</LI>
  <LI>Much better unit tests.</LI>
  <LI>Upgrade powerpoint LALR(1) presentation to LR(1)</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Earlier Versions</H3>
<P>
  There is an earlier version of xcom written in C++ for linux. 
  It is harder to learn than the MATLAB version but
  is more conventional as a system program.
</P>
<P>
  There is an even earlier version of xcom written in C for linux.
  It is called <B>hyper</B> on account of its speedy compile time.
  It includes an emacs-like editor from which all compile&amp;execute
  commands are issued.
</P>
<P>
  Both versions are available as zipped email attachments upon request.
