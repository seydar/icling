<P><B>Phrase Structure</B></P>
<P>
  The <B>parser</B> accepts a
  <A HREF="Lexing.html">token stream</a>,
  discards whitespace and comments,
  and builds a <B>shift/reduce sequence</B>
  according to the phrase structure
  described by the 
  <A HREF="ContextFreeGrammar.pdf"> context-free grammar</A>.
  The shift/reduce sequence is a record of tokens used and CFG
  rules applied.
</P>
<P>
  The shift/reduce sequence is stored as an array in the parser object.
  A shift is represented by a positive integer (the token index) and a
  reduce is represented by a negative integer (the rule number).
  Access to it is supplied by parser methods.
</P>

<P>
  There are two competing parsing algorithms
  called respectively, <B>bottom-up</B> and <B>top-down</B>.
  Each has their advantages and disadvantages.  
  In xcom the two kinds of parsers are both implemented
  and either can be used without changing anything else in xcom.  
  The buzz-word is <A HREF="Glossary.html#plug">plug-compatible</A>.
  The performance is about the same.
</P>

<PRE>
>> xcom x:=1              % run xcom using top-down parser
>> xcom -bottomUp x:=1    % run xcom using bottom-up tables
</PRE>

<P>
  In the real world, the <B>bottom-up</B> 
  techniques require supporting software (usually a version of 
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">yacc<A>).
  The bottom-up technology is well understood and leads to parsers
  about which one can prove some properties.
</P>

<P>
  The <B>top-down</B> techniques can be implemented in 
  any recursive programming language.  
  Like any program, a top-down parser can have bugs.  There are also
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaCC">top-down parser
  generators</A>.
</P>
<P>
  Experts argue endlessly about which technique is better in what
  circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
  The following two links provide descriptions of the two techniques.
