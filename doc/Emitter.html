<H4>Emitter Constructor</H4>
<P>
  The emitter activity is mostly confined to the local constructs
  in the compiled X file.
  The emitter needs information about other files to call subprograms;  
  The constructor is passed external information for this purpose.
</P>

<H4>Semantic Actions</H4>
<P>
  The emitter object implements a collection of methods
  translating semantic actions into hardware actions.
  The semantic actions of X are:

<H4>Tracking Operands</H4>

<P>
  X expressions combine <B>variables</B> and <B>literal constants</B>
  to compute values.  
  The names and constants are transformed by stages between forms 
  acceptable for the target hardware (in this case Intel 32-bit x86). 
</P>
<P>
  An array of operands is maintained.  
  The array contains structs for active operands as well as a pool 
  of available structs for new operands.  
  The status of a particular operand is determined by its status tag. 
  Once assigned, an operand is <B>modified in-place</B> via its
  index and its tag updated accordingly.  
  When the operand is no longer needed, 
  the operand is tagged as available and returned to the pool
  for later use (tag A).

</PRE>
</P>

<P>
  A literal constant (e.g. true, 13, 1.01) is tagged L, the type is set 
  and the text form of the constant, still in the source text. is
  converted to machine form and recorded as the val field.
  Real values are punned to MATLAB int32, and need to be punned back to
  MATLAB single when they are used.
  When the value is needed, an operand transform <B>L2R</B> is provided.  
</P>
<P>
  Each variable is already in the symbol table (an earlier phase).
  When the name is encountered in the tree walk, 
  the type is looked up and copied, 
  the operand is tagged S, 
  and the operand value is set to the symbol table index.  
  When the variable is needed, a transform <B>S2M</B> is provided.
  The type and val fields remains unchanged, the tag becomes M (the memory 
  offset in the frame is the same as the symbol table index).
</P>
<P>
  If the value is needed from memory, a transform <B>M2R</B> is provided.  
  Code is generated to get the value from the frame into a register.  
  The tag becomes R, the type is unchanged.  
  If the type is integer or logical,
  an Intel general register is used and the operand value field is set to
  the register number; if the type is real, the Intel FPS is used and the
  value field is ignored.
</P>
<P>
  The result of a comparison is either in the integer flags (tag F) or
  the FPS flags (tag D).  The test needed is the value.  
  The Intel branching logic requires that the
  information gets to tag F before it can be used.  
  The transform <B>toF</B> insures that a type logical operand is in the flags.
</P>
<P>
  Computer hardware resets the flags after most operations.
  The motto is "flag: use it or lose it".
  There is a provision that insures that a D or F flag is
  never left hanging around (and thereby getting clobbered).
  Unless the logical value is assigned, 
  the tag F operand immediately becomes available (tag A) after use.
</P>
<P>
  When a general register is needed and not available, function <B>R2X</B>
  dumps a busy register into a temporary location in the frame (tag X), 
  the type is unchanged, the value is the temp index.  
  The pending request for a register can then be satisfied.  
  Later, transform <B>X2R</B> recovers the temporarily saved value 
  and frees the temporary location in the frame for later use.
</P>
<P>
  To avoid thrashing temporary stores, the lookup for getting a register
  can protect one register (presumably another register it is immediately 
  going to need).
</P>
<P>
  In an error situation where the failure report must be delayed, the
  operand is tagged as an error (tag E) and the value is the error
  message.  There are no examples in xcom.
</P>

<H4>Emitting Expression Code</H4>
<P>
The emitter object exists to emit machine code.
Each time an operand transitions, corresponding code is sent on
to the assembler as a <A HREF="Glossary.html#sideeffect">side-effect</A>.
The details of the emitters are most easily understood by examining
the emitter code.  Such understanding requires some understanding
of the underlying hardware.
</P>

<H4>Control Logic</H4>
<P>
  Intel x86 control is provided by branching instructions.  
  Branches are used for conditional execution and also subprogram calls.
</P>
<P>
  The X 'if-fi' requires a set of forward branches.  After each failed
  guard the next guard must be tried.  After each successful case, the
  statement following the 'if-fi' must be reached.  If all guards fail,
  the X program must abort.  The branches following the guards are
  conditional; the branches following the statements are unconditional.

  The X 'do-od' requires some of the same forward branches plus a set of
  backward branches.  After each failed guard the next guard must be
  tried.  After a successful case, the loop must  be repeated.  If all
  cases fail, the statement after the do-od must be reached.
  <PRE>

          ,------<--'           |
       :: `-> guard +--> stmts -'

      ,----------<--'
      `-> next stmt
  </PRE>
  Forward branches must be placed in the code stream before the relative
  offset to the destination is known.  This is accomplished by leaving a
  "hole"  for the offset field and then "fixing it up" later.  Backward
  branches can be filled in immediately or can use the "fixup" mechanism.
</P>
<H4>Fixups</H4>
<P>
  Two integers suffice to determine a fixup action: the index of the "hole"
  and the index of the branch destination. The program counter is always 
  left pointing at the next unused byte.  A relative branch therefore is 
  relative to the start of the next instruction.  For a forward branch, 
  which is recorded as soon as the destination is known, the implicit
  destination is the program counter (which points at the next code,
  whatever it is going to be).  The value of the program counter at any
  time is supplied by assembler method getPc. 
  The value of EIP, the hardware program counter might be anything,
  but since everything is self-relative, it does not matter.
</P>
<H4>Code Selection</H4>
<P>
  Code selection is the process of choosing a sequence of machine
  instructions to implement the semantic actions.
  The choices are usually straightforward; they can be seen in EmitX86.m.
  One choice that may seem strange is forcing real values back into
  memory after each operation.
  One consequence is that at most two of the eight FPS registers are used.
  One advantage is that <B>xcom</B> can never cause FPS stack overflow.
  A better reason is to keep the arithmetic consistent.
  The FPS carries 80 bits; <B>xcom</B> variables are 32 bits.
  The results in <B>xcom</B> do not, therefore, depend on the details
  of the FPS management.
  The real reason is that it makes the emitter code easier to understand.
</P>

<P>
  The assembler contains logic to error on FPS overflow, but it never
  happens.
</P>

<H4>Targetting Other Hardware</H4>
<P>
  The xcom compiler, in one form or another, has been implemented for a
  dozen different CPUs.  
  Soon enough, another important "box" will come along, and the 
  emitter will have to be retargetted once again.
  Industrial strength compilers typically impose another layer of
  abstraction between the emitter and assembler (a so-called 
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCOL">UNCOL</A>)
  so that the inevitable retargeting is less painful.
</P>

<H4>Runtime Errors</H4>
<P>
  When something bad happens in the runtime,
  the compiler is obligated to give the X user enough information to fix
  the problem.  
  Divide by zero is a common case.
</P>
<P>
  What the user needs is a message about what happened and the
  location (say file, line and column) of the trouble in the X program.
  There are usually not very many such trouble spots; 
  they can be numbered from 1 to N.
  In xcom, the location and message are precomputed "just in case",
  and the messages are tabulated, 1 to N in an xcom table.
  The runtime merely needs to report the table index back to xcom to
  enable xcom to make a reasonable report.  There is a special early exit 
  called bailout in the assembler for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
  The alternative is to report errors directly from the emitted code.
  This is far too messy a process to inflict on students.  MATLAB already
  knows how to do it, so let it.
