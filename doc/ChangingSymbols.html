<H4>Preliminaries</H4>

<P>Read the general description of the <A HREF="Symbols.html">symbol table</A>.<P>

<P>In MATLAB, in the xcom directory, type
<PRE>
  >> help Symbols.m
</PRE>
and
<PRE>
  >> xcom -symTrace -symDump -noExecute x:=1+r2i(y)
</PRE>
</P>

<H4>Responding to Changes in the CFG</H4>
<P>
Changing the X CFG means changing the opportunities to infer type
and use information.  
A new rule means a new node which in turn requires modification
of the Symbol.m tree walker.
</P>

<H4>Adding a Scalar Type to X</H4>
<P>
Each scalar type has a position in a bit-vector of types.
If the bit-vector is all 1's, all types are possible which
is the same as saying nothing is yet known.
A new type needs a new bit position in the bit-vector.
See variables intType and realType for a model.
</P>

<H4>Adding a Data Structure to X</H4>
<P>
There are three scalar types.  Suppose vectors of all three are needed.
In the strong-type world of X, the appearance of a subscripted variable
is sufficient to determine that all uses of that variable
are in fact array references.  
A single new bit in the symbol table will suffice, say vecType.
The six type possibilities are then
<TABLE BORDER="1" ALIGN="CENTER" CELLPADDING="3">
<TR><TD>logical</TD> <TD>logical vector</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>integer</TD> <TD>integer vector</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>real</TD>    <TD>real vector</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

<P>If subscripts are added the language, then one probably also
wants to add a type inference that the subscript expression is
of type integer.
