<H3>Changing the xcom Syntax Tree Builder</H3>
</CENTER>

<H4>Preliminaries</H4>

<P>In MATLAB, in the xcom directory, type (or cut and paste from here
to the MATALAB command line).
<PRE>
>> help Tree.m
>> xcom -treeTrace -treeDump x:=1
>> addpath tests trials
>> testTree
>> tryTree
</PRE>
or run the tree builder standalone
<PRE>
>> load cfg cfg               % prepare to run Parser standalone
>> EOL = 10;                  % ASCII newline
>> lx = Lexer(cfg, ['x:=1;' EOL 'y:=x']);
>> pr = Parser(lxtr.dump();
>> tr = Tree(pr)
>> tr.dump()
</PRE>

</P>

<P>Read the general description of the <A HREF="SyntaxTree.html">
Syntax Tree</A>.<P>

<H4>But, Why?</H4>
<P>
The syntax tree building code should never have to be changed so long
as using read-only syntax trees is considered sufficient.  
If, on the other hand, one wants abstract syntax trees, or writable
trees, then changes are required.
</P>

<H4>The Arena Implementation</H4>
<P>
Nodes point to nodes, thus some kind of pointer mechanism must exist.
In the case of xcom, 
the syntax tree is <A HREF="Glossary.html#arena">arena-allocated</A>.
</P>
<P>Trees are built strictly depth-first.  The nodes can have any width.
The descendents of a node are either internal nodes, or leaves.
The leaves contain tokens.  
The tree-walker could consult the CFG to find out which descendents
are leaves, and the width of the node,
but in <B>xcom</B> the information is contained within the tree node itself.
The first entry in the node is the rule name (a small integer).
The second entry contains a pattern of 2-bit values.  
Two of the 4 possibilities are NODE and LEAF.
The pattern ends when a two-bit zero (NONE) is encountered in the pattern.
The details are documented in the source file Tree.m.
