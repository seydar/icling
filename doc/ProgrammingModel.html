<H3>XCOM Programming Model</H3>
</CENTER>

<H4>Overview</H4>
<P>
The xcom compiler does <B>not</B> use the 
<A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/object_oriented_programming.html">
MATLAB class system</A> 
(but it could have). Instead it uses 
<A HREF="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/f4-39683.html">
nested functions</A> and function
handles to provide object capabilities.  
</P>

<H4>Enumerations</H4>

<P>
A class of named constants, similar to a 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type">C enum</A>, 
can be built from a cell array of field names.  
By default the base value is 1.  
An optional second argument is provided for other bases (such as 0).  
For example
  <PRE>
    e = enum({'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three'}, 0);
    x = e.one;    % assign 1 to x.
  </PRE>
This facility is used, for instance, to name grammar rules and reserved
words in the parser.
    <PRE>
      rw    = enum(cfg.reserved);             % set up tables
      rule  = enum(cfg.ruleNames);
    </PRE>
</P>
<H4>Objects</H4>
<P>
The combination of nested functions and function handles 
has been used to build an OO compiler, 
with an object for each stage of the compilation process.  
The general model is to call a MATLAB function (the constructor) which 
instantiates an object.  
The result of the constructor is a struct of values and function handles 
giving access to the state of the constructed object.  An example follows:

<HR>
  <PRE>
  function obj = objtest()       % ctor
    
    % variables in the persistent frame accessed by the handles
    x = zeros(1,0, 'int32');
    C = 2007;
    
    obj = public();              % return the public interface
    
    return;   % end of constructor
    
    % ---- nested functions ----
    function set(i, v)           % change the i-th value of x
      x(i) = v;
    end
    
    function v = get(i)          % latest value of the i-th value of x
      v = x(i);
    end
    
    function a = getx()          % latest value of the whole array
      a = x;
    end
    
    % ---- public interface ----
    function o = public()
      o     = struct;            % to pass the public interface
      o.set = @set;              % function handles for "methods"
      o.get = @get;
      o.x   = @getx;             % o.x = x would mean the initial value of x
      o.C   = C;                 % no @ needed because C is not a function
    end
  end

<P>
The local variables of the constructor function are preserved in the 
call frame of the constructor which remains live via the return value 
after the return from the constructor.  
The values at construction-time can be made available in the 
returned struct.  
Values computed later need to be accessed via function handles, 
which are also in the struct.  For example:
</P>
<HR>
  <PRE>
    >> x = objtest();
    >> second = x.get(2)
    second = 0
    >> x.set(2,113);
    >> second = x.get(2)
    second = 113
    >> date = x.C
    date = 2007
  </PRE>
<HR>
    
<P>
Passing one object to the constructor of a second object is the equivalent 
of extending the first object.  All of the public methods and fields of the
first object are available for use in the extended object.
</P>

<H4>Frequent Testing</H4>
<P>
Since MATLAB provides instant turnaround,
the work pattern of do-a-little, test-a-little is feasible.
For that reason xcom comes with an extensive set of 
<A HREF="TestingXcom.html">unit tests</A>
which can and should be run frequently.  
Any new code should get a corresponding entry in the unit tests.
This is all the more important since MATLAB provides very little 
compile-time redundancy, meaning that most errors are run-time errors.
