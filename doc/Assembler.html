<H3>Assembly of CPU Instructions</H3>
</CENTER>

<H4>Assemblers</H4>
<P>
    Machine code is patterns of bits laid out in executable memory.  
    For example, the following snippet of xcom output.
    <BIG>
        <PRE>
            >> xcom -asmDump x:=1
            x86 code dump, 24 bytes code=0xe754220
            5589e58b7508b801000000898600000000b800000000c9c3
            x := 1
        </PRE>
    </BIG>
    One can, in principle, construct such bit patterns by hand.
    In fact, more mnemonic forms are presented by an <B>assembler</B>,
    software typically prepared and maintained by the manufacturer.
    Compilers commonly output a text file containing the mnemonic
    instructions and leave the rest up to the manufacturer.  Such
    output might look like this:
    <BIG>
        <PRE>
            >> xcom -asmTrace x:=1
            Asmx86:    1 pushR EBP (save x86 frame pointer)
            Asmx86:    2 movRR EBP,ESP
            Asmx86:    4 movRP ESI,8 (point at X frame)
            Asmx86:    7 movRC EAX,=1=0x1
            Asmx86:   12 movMR 0,EAX (x)
            Asmx86:   18 movRC EAX,=0=0x0 (no error)
            Asmx86:   23 leave
            Asmx86:   24 ret
        </PRE>
    </BIG>
    Passing the buck to the manufacturer works, 
    but is rather slower than could be achieved by more direct means.
    Besides, the approach of this course is to do it all.
</P>

<H4>Smart Assemblers</H4>
<P>
    It is possible to implement an assembler that does not
    do <EM>exactly</EM> what it is told.  
    The assembler, as an optimizer, 
    can apply the <A HREF="CodeOptimization.html">as if</A> rule,
    actually laying out code that has the same effect as demanded by its
    input, but choosing more efficient code sequences.
    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization">
    Peephole optimization</A> is one example of this kind of "smarts".
</P>

<H4>Intel x86</H4>
<P>
    The x86 line of Intel CPUs is a
    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">
    CISC</A> design; 
    it is the most successful general purpose computer chip ever manufactured.  
    It is remarkable that one design has evolved from a 4-bit uni-processor to 
    a 64-bit multi-processor, 
    largely keeping backward compatibility at each stage.
</P>
<P>
    Here is a <A HREF="IntelX86.html">description</A> the small part of 
    the Intel x86 that is actually used by xcom.
    That is not to say that the x86 is elegant,
    or easy to use, or efficient.  
    The dominance of the x86 design has led to much documentation and 
    lamentation.
</P>

<H4>Execution</H4>

<P>
    The <B>xcom</B> system has its own x86 <B>assembler</B>.  
    It is an object.
    It has a method for each necessary instruction (many fewer than
    available in the full hardware).  
    Each method builds and places corresponding bit patterns into an 
    internal array.  
    When the translation is finished, and the array is full,
    the xcom assembler offers one more method which immediately
    executes the bits.  This is <B>load&amp;go</B>.
    When one needs more instructions, the assembler needs to be 
    <A HREF="ChangingAsm.html">changed</A>.
</P>

<P>
    The <B>xcom</B> system has its own 32-bit x86 
    instruction-by-instruction <A HREF="Emulator.html">emulator</A>.  
    It walks the assembler output,
    emulating each necessary instruction
    The emulator can either zip through the compiled code, 
    printing two lines per instruction executed,
    or it can be run interactively, 
    stepping forward and backward in the instruction trace.
    When one needs more instructions, the emulator needs to be 
    <A HREF="ChangingEmulator.html">changed</A>.

<H4>Other CPUs</H4>
<P>
Over the years, 
the author and students of the xcom system have 
prepared subset assemblers for the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_360">IBM S/360</A>,

and Intel 486.
It is a necessary step in moving the system forward in time.
As of this writing, the 64-bit version of Intel X86 (A64) looms.
