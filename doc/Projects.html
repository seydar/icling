<P> 
  The compiler project is to extend X in some way that you find useful.
  This does not, however, have to be done all in one step.
  One can, to paraphrase Polya, "try a simpler similar problem first."
  Extending <TT>xcom</TT> carries some expectations, 
  such as the ability to do input/output for all types of values.
</P>

<P>
  The result of the compiler project is
  <OL>
    <LI>A live demonstration.</LI>
    <LI>A <A HREF="ProjectReport.html">report</A>
        signed by all team members.

  </OL>
</P>

<P>
  The oft-repeated and <EM>fundamental</EM> beginner's error is trying
  to build the next great language as a learning project.
  Do not try to solve the problems of the world yet.
  You will  have enough of your own.
</P>

<P>
  My advice is to read this page to the end before making any decisions,
  but don't let what you read limit your creativity.
</P>

<P>
  You should first write a number of programs in your proposed extension.
  This provides both a set of tests and
  a confirmation that you will actually find the extension useful.
  You should then extend the X 
  <A HREF="ReferenceX.pdf">reference manual</A>
  to document your language.
  If you do not want to grapple with LaTeX, 
  you can publish an HTML appendix instead.
  Then you are ready to 
  <A HREF="ChangingXcom.html">extend xcom</A>.
  </P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Warm up exercise</B>.  
    <P>
      Add the absolute value function to X.
      You should follow each of the recommended steps to make a
      <A HREF="Warmup.html">little change</A> in X.
      This warm up exercise avoids any language design, 
      and any serious pitfalls.
      It will be hard enough without them.
    </P>
  </LI>

  <LI><B>Change xcom</B>
    <P>
      The <A HREF="ChangingXcom.html">recommended method </A>
      for changing xcom involves the order of events 
      and also the use of the unit tests.  
      When you get stuck, ask for help.
    </P>
  </LI>

  <LI><B>Adding a scalar type (relatively easy)</B>
    <P>
      Suppose you wanted to do more accurate scalar computations.
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Double Precision</B>
      <P>
        You might prefer 64-bit IEEE to the current 
        xcom 32-bit IEEE implementation of real variables.  
        In fact, the hardware always does 64-bit arithmetic;
        xcom goes to some trouble to truncate the results after 
        every operation.
        Expanding the storage for scalars in the run-time frame 
        is the only substantive part of this extension.
        Not much to be learned about compiler writing.
        It is probably reasonable to extend the 
        integer precision to 64 bits
        at the same time so as to have a consistent storage model.
      </P>
      </LI>

      <LI><B>Loooong Integers</B>
      <P>
        Some computations require many digits of integer accuracy.
        One can extend xcom without changing the grammar at all
        by simply changing the meaning of integer constants.
        The (difficult) implementation of the arithmetic
        can be left to the <A HREF="http://gmplib.org/">BIGNUM</A>
        package. Your problems are accessing its functions using the same
        mechanism that xcom currently uses for /, // and rand and also
        how to handle the operands that BIGNUM gives you.
      </P>
      </LI>

      <LI><B>Extended Accuracy</B>
      <P>
        The <A HREF="http://gmplib.org/">BIGNUM</A>
        package offers much more than big integers.
        One could implement big rational numbers or super-accurate reals.
      </P>
      </LI>

      <LI><B>Complex</B>
      <P>
        Replace real with 
        <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex</A>, 
        or add a new type complex.
        You may want to reserve "i" for the square root of -1.
        Do not push too much off onto the lexer.  Expression
        <BIG>
          <PRE>
            a+i*b
          </PRE>
        </BIG>
        is already syntactically correct.  You might want to add
        builtin functions modulus and phase.
      </P>
      </LI>

      <LI><B>People</B>
        <P>
          One group decided to make a scalar type for people.  
          The language had to do with relationships.
          Identifiers starting with a single uppercase letter such as John
          were constants.
        </P>    
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>

  <LI><B>Adding an operator</B>
    <P>
      While one can invent arbitrary operators composed out of ASCII characters,
      it is often best to overload an existing operator to keep X from getting
      cluttered. 
      The addition of set union and string catenation are discussed below under
      the corresponding data structures.
      The <A HREF="Warmup.html">warm up</A> exercise is an example
      where the operator is abs. 
    </P>
    <P>
      Consider
      <UL>
        <LI>
          adding real-valued builtins <B>inf</B> and <B>nan</B>
          and logical-valued builtins <B>isinf</B> and <B>isnan</B>.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          adding &nbsp; ~~ &nbsp; &amp;&amp; &nbsp; || &nbsp; to mean 
          <A HREF="Glossary.html#shortcircuit">short-circuit</A> 
          logical evaluation

        <LI>
          extending &nbsp; ~ &nbsp; &amp; and &nbsp; | &nbsp; to type integer
          (giving 32-bit results).  Perhaps add ^ meaning exclusive or. 
        </LI>
      </UL>
    </P>
    <P>
      All of mathematical notation awaits your implementation.
    </P>
  </LI>

  <LI><B>Adding a data structure</B>
    <P>
      The X language has only scalar variables.  
      This makes it nearly impossible to write useful programs.
      One is, then, highly motivated to add structured data variables.
      By the way, <A HREF="http://docs.python.org/tut/">python</A> 
      has worked out many of the language design problems for 
      data structures.  
      It is OK to peek.
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Sets of scalar values.</B>
      <P>
        One can imagine writing
        <PRE>
    X := {1,2,3};
    y := choice(X);       ` a randomly chosen member
    Z := {i2r(y)} | {3.141592};
    if ~(4.0 in Z) ? fi;  ` assert 4.0 is NOT there
    X := X - {y};         ` discard y from X
        </PRE>
        wherein finite sets of values are allowed.  
        In essence this means adding a few new symbols to X.cfg, 
        three new types 
        (logicalSetType, integerSetType, realSetType) to the symbol table,
        and then carrying through the implementation.
      </P>
      <P>
        A set computation will necessarily <B>allocate new storage</B>
        for each result.
        The storage needs to be accessible from your emitted code,
        so it is more convenient to let C allocate and free the storage.
        <TT>xcom</TT> contains a convenient mechanism for dropping into C 
        for such actions
        (see the implementaton of /, // and rand in file getCfun.c).
        You might consider how to avoid storage leaks.
        You might also consider a set-complement operation.
      </P>
      <P>
        Note the implied overloading of the '|' operator to mean set union above.
        You may, of course, choose one of many other ASCII notational devices,
        perhaps '||' or '|_|' or '\/' or 'U'.
      </P>
      <P>
        The sets idea quickly leads to sets of anything, including sets.
        The mathematics can get deep fast.  Step carefully.
      </P>
    </LI>

    <LI><B>Strings</B>
    <P>
      One can imagine writing
      <BIG>
        <PRE>
          X := "abc" + "def";
          y := 3;
          Y := X[y:y+1];
          z := c2i(X[2]);
        </PRE>
      </BIG>
    <P>
    </LI>

    <LI><B>Vectors of scalar values</B>
      <P>
        One can imagine writing
        <BIG>
          <PRE>
            y := 3;
            X := [1,2,y];
            Y[3] := X[y-1];
          </PRE>
        </BIG>

      <P>
        As in MATLAB, vectors expand storage to hold any value 
        sent their way.  Accessing an undefined value causes a run error.
        The representation of a vector in memory might be a simple
        version of the MATLAB representation.  In the variable is
        an address, which points to a header, which points to the data.
        Both the header and the data must be allocated.  The data might
        need to be reallocated as the computation proceeds.

            y := 3;
            X := &lt;1,2,y>;

      Objects and structs are hierarchical data structures with named
      fields.  In C one might write
      <PRE>
        struct T {
        int x;
        float y;
        } t;
      </PRE>
      to get a two-field struct.  In MATLAB once writes
      <PRE>
        t.x = 0; 
        t.y = 1.0;
      </PRE>
      to get the same effect and, in addition, initialize the fields.
    </P>
    <P> 
      In an extension to X one might write
      <PRE>
        T = {x,y};
        t = T{0,1.0};
      </PRE>
      where the first assignment makes T a two field struct type,
      and the second initializes the fields and, as a side effect,
      permanently binds the type of the fields of type T.

      <LI><B>Doing science</B>
        <P>
          Not all computations are just grown-up FORTRAN.  
          Some science requires algebraic manipulations.
          Some has data that is nothing like the computers give us.
          Compiler writers are rarely competent in such science,
          and such scientists are rarely competent in compiler writing.
          There is an opportunity for a big advance here.

              A chemist writes formulas in which the operands are chemicals.
              The equations enforce constraints and imply reactions.
              The HTML presentation here does not do justice to this idea
              but X can be typeset by xcom or even rendered by 
              MATLAB graphics.

      <P>
        If one is going to achieve Dijkstra's "compelling and deep 
        logical beauty," one must forgo much of the paraphernalia of 
        conventional general purpose programming languages.
        This spartan attitude is most likely to succeed when the
        objective of the language is rigorously limited, 
        the linguistic additions are few, 
        and additions are well suited to meeting that objective.  
        See some ideas on computer language
        <A HREF="LanguageDesign.html">design</A> to get a fresh perspective.
