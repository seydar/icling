<H3>Top-down Parsing</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>The top-down method relies on the IOG as a programming template to 
specify some <B>mutually recursive functions</B>.  
Each function is responsible for one phrase name, 
so the total number of such functions can be predicted by examining
the CFG.  For <A HREF="Xcfg.html">X</A>, there are 55.
</P>

<P>
The whole process of writing the recursive processor is presented
in a simplified version based on the Proposition Cfg in the class
<A HREF="RecursiveParsing.pdf">handout</A>. 
</P>
<P>
The first steps toward writing the parser functions use grammar 
transformations.  
An experienced parser author sometimes does not bother with explicit 
transformations, 
doing them mentally at the keyboard while preparing the parser.
</P>

<H4>Label the Rules</H4>
<P>
The first step is to <B>label</B> 
the CFG rules in a systematic way. 
In effect, this changes the context-free grammar into an 
<A HREF="InputOutputGrammar.pdf">input-output grammar</A>.
The labels are the members of <EM>V<SUB>O</SUB></EM>.
One can merely number the rules, as is done for Proposition
in the section on <A HREF="ContextFreeGrammar.pdf">context-free grammars</A>, 
or use moderately mnemonic labels 
incorporating the phrase name as done in the labelling
<A HREF="Xlabel.html">example</A> for X, 
or use wholly mnemonic labels as is done in xcom where
the second rule for vars
<PRE>
vars
  vars , id
</PRE>
is labelled
<PRE>
  vars_varsCOMMAid
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The issue is maintainability.  Making a change in xcom should not cause
the programmer to have to change unrelated names (as would be the case
in first two example labels above). 
The labels in xcom are in fact generated in a predictable way by
the Cfg object based on the whole text of each rule.
To see them, in MATLAB, type
<PRE>
  >> c=Cfg(xread('X.cfg'));
  >> c.ruleNames
</PRE>
The input-output grammar is closely analogous the the 
<B>yacc</B> input language.
The equivalent of the xcom rule labels in the IOG  
are yacc actions expressed as C text enclosed in curly braces.

</P>

<H4>Construct the IOG</H4>
<P>
The second step is to <A HREF="RecursiveParsing.pdf">transform</A> 
the <A HREF="Xlabel.html">labelled</A> CFG 
into the regular expression form of an <A HREF="Xiog.html">IOG for X</A>, 
removing left recursion and dragging the rule labels along.  
Changing the CFG to the free-form notation to distinguish phrase names, 
input symbols, and output symbols is part of the task.  
</P>

<H4>Write Recursive Parsing Functions</H4>
<P>
The third step is to implement the 
<A HREF="RecursiveParsing.pdf">recursive functions</A>
in analogy to those for Proposition.  
For X, the functions are methods in mxcom/m/Parser.m.  
The current token must be updated immediately after passing any token
comparison test.  
The output actions have to be turned into reduce calls.
The entire effect of parsing is to produce a 
<B>shift/reduce sequence</B>.
</P>

<H4>Test Early and Often</H4>
<P>
The fourth step is to implement a unit test for the parser.
The file mxcom/m/tests/testParser.m is such a test, 
but it is nothing to be proud of since it depends on a "gold file"
of prerecorded results.
My feelings will not be hurt if you do a much better job.
</P>

<H4>Making a Small Change in the Parser</H4>
<P>See the details <A HREF="ChangingParser.html">here</A>.</P>

<H4>Why not Something Simpler?</H4>
<P>There have been many unique solutions to the parsing problem over the 
years, from the earlier Fortran compilers onward.
What has been shown above is one of the best.
</P>

<P>One can imagine not using either the REG or IOG and still be able to
write recursive parsers.  You can.  The transformations leading to the
recursive parsing template are, generally speaking, not that difficult
to do in your head while you are typing.
</P>

<P>What you cannot do is skip the transformations.  Take, for example,
the rules
<PRE>
Disjuction 
  Disjunction | Conjunction
  Conjunction
</PRE>
One could write
<PRE>
function Disjunction()
  if (???)
    Disjunction();
    accept('|');
    Conjunction();
    reduce(1)
  else
    Conjunction();
    reduce(2);
  end
end
</PRE>  
</P>
    
<P>The first problem is what to put in place of the <TT>???</TT>.
The meaning of the <TT>???</TT> has to be "if there is a '|' coming and
nothing is going to get in the way (like a ')').
</P>
<P> The second problem is that Disjunction calls itself immediately,
which will lead to a <B>stack overflow</B> and no answer.
</P>

<P>Cfg left-recursion has to be turned into an iteration, in your head
or in your IOG.
</P>

<P>On the other hand, if the rules are tried in the opposite order,
<PRE>
Disjuction 
  Conjunction
  Disjunction | Conjunction
</PRE>
you could try <B>backtracking</B> from any point of failure and failing 
over to the second alternative.  
This solution works but is not efficient.
</P>

<P>And, of course, the <B>bottom-up</B> methods also will work and are 
competitive.
The table builder is usually a bit tedious to work with but the eventual
parser is "as good as it gets".
</P>

Footnote:
<P>
  I learned top-down compiling by reading the 
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_large_systems">
  Burroughs B5000 Algol-60</A> compiler in 1963.  
  It was self-compiling.  Kudos to Lloyd Turner and Dave Dahm.
  I learned bottom-up compiling while implementing part of 
  <A HREF="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=365202">Euler</A>
  for Niklaus Wirth and Helmut Weber.
