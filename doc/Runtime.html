<H4>The 32-bit x86 Hardware</H4>

<P>
The 32-bit <A HREF="IntelX86.html">Intel x86</A> hardware is designed 
around an expected programming model.  
Only a little of that model is used in xcom.
</P>

<H4>The 32-bit x86 Calling Sequence</H4>

<P>
ESP points to the top of the hardware stack 
(actually, the bottom since the stack grows toward address 0x0).
There are push and pop instructions to manipulate ESP.
EBP points to the hardware stack frame.
The subroutine call instruction pushes EIP onto the stack 
(decrementing ESP by 4) and resets EIP to the called subroutine.
The first thing a subroutine does is push EBP onto the stack 
and reset it to ESP.
So, EBP points to its old value.
Parameters get pushed before the call,
so they are accessed via a positive offset from EBP.
Locals are pushed by the subroutine itself, 
so they are accessed via negative offset from EBP.
There are a couple of instructions to unwind all of this and
get back to the calling point.
</P>

<P>
The <B>xcom</B> subprogram call does not put X parameters or locals
on the hardware stack.  
Instead it allocates a frame from the heap and puts variables there.
There are only three values in the hardware stack frame:
EIP,EBP and a pointer to the allocated frame.
The X frame memory is returned to the heap after exit 
from the called subroutine.
The malloc/free pair is pretty expensive.
A self-respecting C compiler would use the stack as intended
by the great gods of Intel.
</P>

<P>
The compiled code has to be able to reach the local variables in 
the frame.
The ESI register, 
normally a part of special instructions to access blocks of memory, 
is used by <B>xcom</B> to point at the allocated frame.
ESI is set by the xcom subprogram immediately after it pushes EBP.
Most X data accessing instructions are ESI relative.
</P>

<H4>The X Runtime Frame</H4>

<P>
The xcom compiler, running in MATLAB, launches from the x86 run stack.
The frame for the X function is allocated by MATLAB and initialized to the
input values before the call.
MATLAB calls MEX file runX86.c with the address of the executable bits
and the address of the X frame.
In runX86.c the address of the executable is cast to a pointer-to-function.
That (fake) function is called with a single parameter, the address of
the X frame.  At this point your code leaves the civilized world of
code compiled by the C compiler, passing into code emitted by you (xcom).
</P>

<P>
The <B>prolog</B> of the executable bits first pushes EBP 
and resets ESP (required).
The address of the X frame is put into ESI.
Finally <EM>all</EM> the registers are pushed into the hardware stack
(callee save).
After doing its assigned subprogram task, the executable bits terminate
with the <B>epilog</B> which reverses the prolog and returns control
to the caller.
</P>

<P>
After return from the X subprogram, 
the output values are found in the malloc-d X frame, 
which is accessible to the caller (which malloc-d it in the first place). 
The output values are moved to their final resting place.
</P>

<P>
The situation for X calling X is different only in that the outputs
are moved back into the malloc-d frame of the caller.
In this case the work is treated like a builtin call in getCfun.c.
</P>

<P>
Here is a picture of the run stack.  MATLAB is executing.
When MEX runX86 is called, a new x86 run stack frame is pushed
onto the stack (the stack grows toward address 0).
The MEX code extracts the needed information from the mxArrays
passing in the executable bits and the malloc-ed X frame pointer.
Then it calls the executable bits, passing the pointer.
The prolog code in the X function pushes another stack frame
onto the x86 stack and puts the frame pointer in register ESI.
</P>

<H4>The Frame Contents</H4>
<P>
The frame is a preallocated array of 32-bit entries, 
one entry for each local variable in the called X program
<EM>and</EM> one entry for each temporary variable.
The M type of the frame is a vector of int32.
From M code, the vector can be accessed via subscripts.
The data format of an entry may be either 32-bit IEEE float 
or 32-bit C int.
The <B>32-bit int</B> values can be handled as normal MATLAB data.
The xcom use of the frame entries for <B>32-bit real</B>
depends on two C MEX files 
<BIG><TT>f2i</TT></BIG> and <BIG><TT>i2f</TT></BIG>
which <A HREF="Glossary.html#pun">pun</A> the entries to and from IEEE format.
</P>

<H4>Calling X Subprograms</H4>
<P>
When the main X program calls an X subprogram 
(necessarily named in the original command line starting xcom),
the call proceeds via static C function <B>XCOMlink</B>.
<OL>
<LI>A new frame is allocated.</LI>
<LI>The frame is prefilled with the subprogram input arguments.</LI>
<LI>The subprogram is called.</LI>
<LI>Upon return, the subprogram output results are extracted from the frame.</LI>
<LI>The frame is freed.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>
An example of the call/return mechanism is given in the comments
preceding static C function XCOMlink in getCfun.c.
</P>

<H4>The Runtime Library</H4>
<P>
Some functions desirable in X are most conveniently implemented 
as builtins in C.
The interface to builtins (including rand) is provided by C function 
    <BIG>
        <PRE>    getCfun.c</PRE>
    </BIG>
</P>
<P>
Each desired builtin is implemented as a static function within this file.
The required name of the static function for builtin xxx is XCOMxxx.
The purpose of getCfun is to translate the name (e.g. 'rand')
into the machine address of the corresponding static function 
(e.g. &amp;XCOMrand).
The address is then later used to call the builtin as required.
XCOMlink is analogous to a conventional link/loader.
</P>

<H4>The 64-bit x86 Hardware</H4>

<P>In some ways the 64 bit hardware can be ignored;  
  the 32-bit instructions are still there.
  On the other hand, MATLAB compiled on a 64-bit platform uses
  the 64-bit calling sequence, 
  which is not compatible with the 32-bit version.  
  The solution is to start the compiled code with a 64-bit compatible
  prolog, and then, when everything is under control, switch back to 32.
</P>

<P>One could, of course, reimplement Emitx86.m and Assembler.m to 
  emit native 64-bit code.  This is a good idea and a lot of work.
  It has the disadvantage of not running on older hardware at all.
  So, here the choice is to stay in the 32-bit subset and 
  insure the transition from 64-to-32 is smooth.
</P>

<P>The 64-bit Application Binary Interface is documented 
  <A HREF="abi_64.pdf">here</A>.
</P>

<P>A code dump for a simple C file peek.c 
  from gcc for both 32-bit and 64-bit linux is
  included <A HREF="peek.html">here</A>.
