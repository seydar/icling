<H3>Intel x86 Eumlator</H3>
</CENTER>
<H4>Preliminary</H4>

<P>
In MATLAB in the mxcom directory, try
<BIG>
<PRE>
  >> help Emulatex86.m
</PRE>
</BIG>
and
<BIG>
<PRE>
  >> xcom -exeTrace x:=1
</PRE>
</BIG>
and
<BIG>
<PRE>
  >> xcom -interactive x:=1
</PRE>
</BIG>
</P>

<H4>Overall Design</H4>
<P>
  The emulator exists to allow the compiler writer to examine emitted
  code <EM>in vivo</EM>, providing a way to debug the generated code.
  It is limited to a single X program at a time 
  since the implementation of the
  emulation of the calling sequence would be more complex than valuable.
  Since any subprogram is also a program, this should not be a serious
  limitation.
</P>

<P>
  The emulator is faced with the same decisions made by the Intel hardware.
  The only significant difference is that the emulator 
  <B>prints two lines of text</B>, 
  one giving the information about the instruction that is getting executed, 
  and the other about the state of the registers after execution.
  And, of course the emulator is a bit slower than the hardware.
  Here is a sample. The 4<SUP>th</SUP> instruction of 
<BIG>
<PRE>
  x:=1 
</PRE>
</BIG>
moves a constant 1 into register EAX.  
The line of 8 numbers is the value of the 8 registers.
</P>
<PRE>
   4: 0xe5be306: movRC EAX,=1
         1          0          0          0   na    na  0x0228e780   na 
</PRE>
<P>
  The current, and any imaginable future, state of the emulator is that
  a <B>small percentage</B> of the Intel x86 is implemented.  
  It should error if it encounters an unimplemented instruction.
  If it does, you will have to <A HREF="ChangingEmulator.html">fix</A> it.
</P>
<P>
  The emulator has two modes of operation.  
  The <B>xcom</B> flag -exeTrace requests emulation until a return 
  (RET = 0xC3) is found.
  The <B>xcom</B> flag -interactive emulates the first instruction, 
  then waits for input from the user.
  The user choses a number of steps (positive or negative).
  The emulator silently does the steps, printing the last one and 
  asking for input again.
  Given the value <B>inf</B> for steps, it will run to completion.
</P>

<P>
  Note that the emulator is able to go forward and <B>backward</B>.
  You can step ahead a chunk, then step back if you missed something.
  This trick is accomplished by silently saving every possible line of 
  trace information as a history list.  Stepping back just goes to
  the right place in the history list and displays the information.
  Stepping forward extends the history list if necessary, 
  then reports the next entry.  
  Presumably this algorithm will get in trouble if the memory demand
  of the history list gets very large.  
  But that has not happened yet.
</P>

<P>
  Intel x86 instructions are decoded left-to-right.  
  Usually the granularity is one byte, 
  but for some very frequently used instructions,
  only the first 5 bits need to be looked at.
  The emulator has a main loop, executed once per x86 instruction.
  At the top of the loop the initial bits of the code stream
  (as pointed to by EIP) are examined.
</P>
<P>
  Based on the gathered data, a large switch is executed.
  Each case holds one or more instruction implementations.
  Each implementation updates the emulated state 
  (some X arrays and variables),
  prints the two required lines, and drops to the bottom of loop.  
  Etc.
</P>

<H4>MODREG</H4>
<P>
  One consistent pecularity of the x86 is called mod-reg.  
  There are three fields in a byte, called m, r/m and reg.
  The m is (loosely) a mode, r/m is often a register but 
  can be other things, reg is almost always a register.
  The emulator encapsulates the unpacking of this
  kind of field in a few M functions.
<BIG>
  <PRE>
    function m  = UN_MOD(mr)
    function rm = UN_R_M(mr)
    function r  = UN_REG(mr)
    function [r, rm, m] = UN_MOD_REG(mr)
  </PRE>
</BIG>
</P>

<H4>Hardware Computations</H4>
<P>
  Computer arithmetic used to be different for every manufacturer.
  Integers were implemented as decimal, 
  or ones-complement or twos-complement.
  Floating point had a dozen formats on the popular machines.
  Nowadays, however, IEEE floating point and 2's complement are standard.
</P>
<P>
  One of the jobs of the emulator is to get exactly the same results
  that the hardware gets for the same operation.  
  The MATLAB integer arithmetic (8 types in all) does not do the job.
  For example 
  <BIG><PRE>   int8(9)/int8(5) == int8(2) </PRE></BIG>
  and
  <BIG><PRE>   int8(300) == 127 </PRE></BIG>
  The easiest way to understand MATLAB integers is to think of them as
  just small floating point values.  The max corresponds to IEEE inf.
  Like inf, the maximum value is unchanged when something is 
  added to it.  Unlike inf, you can subtract something from it.
  <BIG><PRE>   int8(300)+1-1 == int8(126) </PRE></BIG>
  Whenever you do anything that gives a non-integral result,
  the value is rounded.
  To make things a little more complicated, the hardware sometimes
  treats a sequence of bits as signed, and sometimes as unsigned.
  All of this detail is implemented in MATLAB function arith.m.
