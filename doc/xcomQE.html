  It is accepted in the industry that giving software to students
  will expose many bugs.  
  It is not so much a result of "1000 monkeys at the keyboard"
  but rather fresh eyes in front of a curious mind.
  New users do the darndest things.... take it from me.

  I have ported my compiler teaching tools from C++ to MATLAB 
  over a period of 2 years 2005-2007.  Since them I have added a couple
  of features and done some refactoring.
  This M version of xcom is working, 
  but it has <B>gaps</B> in the implementation and
  has been used by me in a class only a few times.
  Neither the code documentation nor the course materials 
  have been carefully reviewed.
  7000 lines of M code, 7000 lines of HTML, and 5000 lines of TeX.
  There be bugs here!  
</P>

<P>
  I do not think the raw nature of the materials will 
  intefere much with the learning experience.  
  Finding a good bug is instructive.
  Being suspicious of the materials is much better for learning
  than a "the instructor <B>must</B> be right" attitude.
</P>

<P>
  I will be very appreciative of any help you (the students) 
  can give me.  The MathWorks file exchange has a public
  comments section for each submission.  Feel free to use it.
  An email is probably the best way to get longer ideas to me.
  Try mckeeman{at}cs.dartmouth.edu.  
</P>

<P>
  Any concern of yours is a concern of mine.  
  Spelling, clumsy wording, dead URL links, bugs, inefficiencies.... 
  and so on and on and on.
