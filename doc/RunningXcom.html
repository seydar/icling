<H4>The MATLAB Command Line</H4>
<P>
The MATLAB command line serves both as a command interpreter (like a shell)
and a place to write programs (complex syntax).  
The command line interpreter figures out what you are doing each time
it looks at its line of input.
If the MATLAB command line interpreter decides you are using it like a shell,
it will interpret the characters as blank-separated strings;
if it decides otherwise, it will interpret the characters according
to the MATLAB language syntax.  
These two modes are called <B>command syntax</B>
and <B>function syntax</B>, respectively 
(Actually, command line interpretation is a bit more complicated than that, 
but the fine details are not important for this presentation.)
</P>

<H4>Running xcom</H4>

<P>
The normal way to run xcom is using the command syntax.
<PRE>
>> xcom x:=y+1
</PRE>
The above command syntax calls the function xcom.m and gives it a single 
argument, the string <TT>'x:=y+1'</TT>.  
This usage is exactly the same as function syntax
<PRE>
>> xcom('x:=y+1')
</PRE>
The command syntax is convenient but has some hidden features that
can lead to confusing results.  
The xcom call is so simple that you will rarely get into trouble using 
command syntax.
Of course, you cannot put white space in the program text above.
<PRE>
>> xcom x := y+1
</PRE>
will start to work on 'x' as a whole program, 
and immediately discover that there is no <BIG><TT>:=</TT></BIG> 
(which is syntactically required).
You get a parse error. It is OK, however, to write
<PRE>
>> xcom 'x := y+1'
</PRE>
since one of the MATLAB command line features is to obey quotation marks.
</P>

<P>
<B>xcom</B> also has two ways to interpret its input strings.
The examples above were all interpreted as X language.
The effect is to compile&amp;go.
If the input argument had happened to end exactly in the characters 
<TT>'.x'</TT>,
the whole argument would be taken as a file name.  Thus
<PRE>
>> xcom x/pi.x
</PRE>
runs the file pi.x in the x directory.
</P>

<P>
xcom has no memory.  Each run starts from a <B>clean slate</B>.
There is no global frame or any other holdover from run to run.
</P>

<H4>Multiple X Programs in One Run</H4>
<P>
Since X programs can call each other, 
they need a way to find each other.
In fact, all of them have to be listed on the command line.
<PRE>
>> xcom x/pi.x x/callpi.x
</PRE>
compiles two programs, and calls the last one on the list.
Every other program on the command line is available to 
the main program and each other.
</P>

<H4>xcom Flags</H4>
<P>
xcom has <B>a lot</B> of flags controlling its behavior.
Most of them trigger off informative diagnostics
designed to ease the task of learning how to change the compiler.
All of the flags start with '-', which can never start a valid
X program.  The whole list of flags can be displayed by running
<PRE>
>> help xcom
</PRE>
which uses the standard MATLAB help facility to display the
first comment in the file xcom.m.
</P>
<P>
Some of the flags are specific to the following command line argument;
some are global to the whole compile.  For example, using a 
<B>global flag</B>,
<PRE>
>> xcom -noExecute x:=y+1
</PRE>
compiles the program but does not execute it. Try adding a 
<B>local flag</B>
<PRE>
>> xcom -noExecute -asmDump x:=y+1
</PRE>
to see the dump final compiled form of 'x:=y+1' 
without the user having to respond to the interactive input and output.
</P>
