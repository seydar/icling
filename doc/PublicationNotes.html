<H4>Distribution</H4>

<P>
The publisher is the MathWorks File Exchange.
</P>

<P>
The user of the xcom development system
will not be hampered by <B>copyright</B>.
Almost all author rights are ceded
in the copyright statements.  
</P>

<P>
The distribution consists of two main parts, (1) the development directory
for the MATLAB version of xcom, and (2) textual material helpful for
learning how to use xcom.  The latter constitutes a short course in 
compilers based on material used by the author at Dartmouth.
</P>

<P>
The implementation of xcom is entirely in MATLAB including a few MEX files
for direct access to the hardware and C program libraries.
</P>

<P>
  xcom works on Intel x86 Apple, WIN and Linux.
</P>

<P>
The textual material is in HTML and PDF.  
In general HTML is used when hyperlinks are needed;
PDF from LaTeX is used when typesetting is appropriate;  
PDF from PowerPoint is used for material that requires a lot of graphics.
All of the sources are in the xcom distribution.  
</P>

<H4>Document Preparation</H4>

<P>
The HTML is hand written, except for the slides of the Stanford seminar 
talk which were produced by postprocessing the HTML output of the 
MATLAB publish feature (see publish2slides.m).
</P>

<P>
  PDF comes from <A HREF="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</A>.  
  On linux, LaTeX comes with the operating system.  
  On Windows, the free
  <A HREF="http://miktex.org/">MiKTeX</A> implementation 
  of LaTeX was used, and, of course, powerpoint. 
  Adobe Acrobat Distiller supplies the powerpoint-to-PDF conversion.
</P>

<H4>xcom Utilities</H4>

<P>
  The utilities are run in the xcom/m dirctory.
