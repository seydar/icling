<h2>Haiku as a Notation</h2>
<p>

<a href = http://www.faximum.com/aha.d/keirule.htm>Haiku</a> is a poetic form
originating in Japanese antiquity.<br>Below is a very weak example. <p>

<em>
Haiku poetry<br>
5-7-5 syllables<br>
Arranged in 3 lines<p>
</em>

Presumably, these prettier examples are better:<p>

Like all poetry, Haiku is capable of reaching deeply into the mind.  It  can be
appreciated for its obvious surface meaning, for a surprise that is revealed,
for the visual feast provided by the script in  which is it written, by puns on
the words which give another meaning, or puns on the spoken sounds, or visual
puns on ideographs.  At its best, Haiku does all of these and more at once.
