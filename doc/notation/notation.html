<h2>The Concept of Notation</h2>

<p align="right">
<em>... by far the most important step<br>
    ... to civilization was writing</em><br>
Will Durant

<em>The King denounced it [writing]<br>
    as an enemy of civilization</em><br>

<h2><a href=babel.html><em>What have we done</em> </a> to ourselves?</h2>

<p>
  The term <em>language</em> has a technical meaning.  
  The term <em>notation</em> is less precise -- 
  it has visual and psychological components that we do not,
  at present, know how to quantify.  
  Like poetry, a notation can be appreciated and discussed.  
  Like poetry, a good notation is often a surprise, even a delight.  
  Like poetry, a good notation reaches past the tedium of mere reason,
  enabling patterns of thought otherwise inaccessible to our poor meat
  computers.
</p>

<p>
  The power of notation has captured the attention of experts and they have 
  <a href=quotes.html>commented</a> thereon.
</p>

<p>
  It is my opinion that the appearance of a useful notation has the
  effect on science akin the effect the appearance of a successful
  mutation has on nature.  A new intellectual plateau is soon populated
  by those wielding the new mental tool to explore in detail a vista
  formerly only glimpsed, and then only by genius.
</p>

<p>
  To give substance to my claims, 
  I offer some of the notations that
  have opened vistas to me.

<ul>
    <li><a href=musicnotation.html>Music</a> (from which the word notation comes)
    <li><a href=dance.html>Dance</a>
    <li><a href=termcap.html>Terminal capabilities</a> (the best of CS)
    <li><a href=numbers.html>Numbers</a> (as an example of judging notation)
    <li><a href=mathematics.pdf>Mathematics in general</a>
    <li><a href=logic.html>Propositions, predicates, and sets</a>
    <li><a href=geometry.html>Geometry</a>
    <li><a href=algorithms.html>Algorithms</a>
    <li><a href=calculus.pdf>Differential and integral calculus</a>
    <li>Feynman diagrams
    <li><a href=grammars.html>Language description</a>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are others that I believe have compelling stories, but lead to places I
have not yet been.
<ul>
    <li><a href=organic.html>Organic chemistry</a>
    <li><a href=knit.html>Knitting</a>
    <li><a href=haiku.html>Haiku</a>
</ul>
</p>

<P>
  One of the most convincing demonstrations of the power of notation
  in mathematics and physics is in the lovely book
  <A HREF="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/BAIEQU.html">The Equations</A>, 
  <B>icons of knowledge</B> by Sander Bais. 
</P>

<p>
The preceding stories open the possibility that we, in computer science, 
have deliberately limited our scientific reach by restricting our 
professional art-form to ASCII.  
The compelling elegance reached in other arts and sciences has eluded us.  
Occasional glimpses of deeper resonances 
have peeked through the pedestrian keyboard with the appearance of 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29">APL</A> and 
<A HREF="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</A> 
(<A HREF="http://unicode.org/charts">charts</A>)
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">wiki</A>) and 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</A>.
</p>

<h2>What to do about it?</h2> <p>Presuming that computer users need
notation, there are several technical problems to solve.
<em>Their</em> notation must also be <em>computer readable, writable
and efficiently executable</em>.  Fonts are part of the answer.
Easy-to-write compilers is another.  I took on the latter task.  I am
still waiting for Leibniz.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a classmate of mine invented M for MATLAB and it turned
out to have an evolutionary niche.  It is even taught as a beginning
programmang language (at Cornell, for instance).  Now, two decades
later, I am rewriting his compiler.  You cannot be impatient when you
are waiting for a notation to be born.</p>
