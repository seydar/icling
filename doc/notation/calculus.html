<p><b>Leibniz</b>, a few years junior to <b>Newton</b>, traveled to
Britain to show Newton his work in calculus.  Newton stayed with the
dots.  British mathematicians proudly refused to recognize the
"continental" notation.  So, the calculus was developed by
</p>
<p align=center>
Bernoulli, Euler, Fourier, Lagrange, Laplace, Legendre, Poisson...
</p>

<p>One hundred years later a secret society was formed at Cambridge to
study the notation introduced by Leibniz.  Simple formal algebraic
rules such as
</p>

<p align=center>
(dx/dy).(dy/dz) = dx/dz
</p>

<p>actually represented limit theorems, but one did not have to rethink
the limits time after time.
</p>

<p>In a final twist of fate, the <b>Bishop Berkely</b>, who despised the
shameless modern disbelief in God, used Leibniz' notation to twit
his opponents (the mathematicians among them), saying "There is more
evidence of the existence of God than of being able to divide by
zero."  He had learned his schoolboy algebra well.
