<h2>A Simple Grammar Notation</h2>

<p>Grammars are a major topic in this course.
Here we are only concerned with a clean notation for writing down concrete
grammars.  
At its simplest, a grammar is a set of <em>substitution rules</em>. 
There is a left hand side (naming the symbol being defined) and a right hand
side (giving the definition).
</p>

<p>
Any contiguous sequence of non-blank characters is a <em>symbol</em>.  
A symbol that appears on the left margin is being defined.
All other symbols stand for themselves (literals).  The definitions,
represented sequences of symbols (separated by whitespace), appear immediately
below the defined symbol and are indented.  An empty definition is allowed and
is represented by a blank line.  Empty lines at the end of a sequence of
definitions are ignored.  Referring to the grammar for binary integer below,
there are four definitions. The last two give the simplest cases.  The other
two extend the simple cases, one binary digit at a time.</p>

<pre>
binaryInteger
   binaryDigit
   binaryInteger binaryDigit
binaryDigit
   0
   1
</pre>

<p>
Operationally, a grammar starts with some selected symbol 
(by convention, usually the first).  
If there are one or more definitions for that symbol, 
the definition may be substituted for the selected symbol, 
possibly increasing the number of defined symbols.  
Given the resulting substituted sequence, 
one may repeat substitutions indefinitely, 
in any order, 
until there are no more symbols with definitions remaining in the sequence.  
In the case of binary numbers, one can easily see that
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>The substitutions may continue indefinitely.
<li>Whenever there are no more substitutions to make (only literals remain),
the result is, in fact, a binary integer
<li>There is a sequence of substitutions leading to every finite binary integer.
</ol>

<p>
The defined symbols are called <em>phrase names</em>.
</p>

<p>Grammars can be used for many things.  Computer languages usually
have grammars.
For <a href=c.html>C</a> the grammar is an international standard.
For <a href=java11.html>Java 1</a> the grammar is a proprietary standard.
