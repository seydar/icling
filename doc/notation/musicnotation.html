<h2>Musical Notation</h2>
<P>
  Music has notation, and has had it for 1000 years. 
  The influence of music notation is apparent from the attention paid to it
  by the governing powers of the times.
</P>
<P>
  Here are my hand-copied examples
  from the 9<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> centuries.

  A Benedictine monk named 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_d%27Arezzo">Guido</a>
  introduced the idea of the staff notation, with a mark (called a note) for each
  sound, with vertical position giving the pitch, with decorations indicating the
  duration.  There is more to it, of course, but the essential point was that
  musical notation allowed one to write down a recipe for a piece of music that
  <ul>
    <li>provided for multiple sounds (including words) at one point in time
    </li>
    <li>made harmony natural (there is some science in this)</li>
    <li>provided for many different instruments
    </li>
    <li>could be played in real time as it was read from the page.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
  
<P>
  One can debate the details, but the result is incontrovertible. Music took
  off.  Without Guido's idea, no Mozart, no Beethoven.

  Curiously, in 1322, the church 
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony">
  rejected</A> its own invention.  
  Two centuries later, the breakaway Lutheran church adopted 
  the rich new music as its own.  
  Another four centuries later, Pope Paul had relented: 
  <A HREF="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html">
  article 116</A> reads:
  <EM>
    The Church acknowledges Gregorian chant as specially suited 
    to the Roman liturgy: therefore, other things being equal, 
    it should be given pride of place in liturgical services.
    But other kinds of sacred music, especially polyphony, 
    are by no means excluded from liturgical celebrations, 
    so long as they accord with the spirit of the liturgical action, 
    as laid down in Art. 30.
  </EM>


</P>

<p>
  This is a peculiarly Western view of music.  Other cultures may have
  similar stories.
</p>

<h3>Project suggestion</h3>

<p>
  From a technical viewpoint, how does musical notation "work?"  It is 
  relatively easy to invent other equivalent ways to write down music.  
  The desire for computer input in recent years has spawned a number of 
  <a href=http://www.walshaw.plus.com/abc/>ascii-based notations</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The project is an examination of musical notation to determine what it is
  that has made it win the Darwinian battle for the minds of a millenium of
  musicians.
</p>

<h3>Project suggestion</h3>

<p>
  One can write a program to transform ascii-based notation into sheet music.
  Here is a primitive example.  Can you do better?  
  (Java must be enabled to see the results.)
