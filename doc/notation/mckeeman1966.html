  It is an important to <br>
  forbid non-sense as it is<br>
  to permit good sense
</i>
</p>

<p>
The universe and its reflection in the ideas of man have wonderfully
complex structures.  Our ability to comprehed this complexity and
perceive an underlying simplicitry is intimately bound with our
ability to symbolize and communciate our experience.  The scientist
has been free to extend and invent language whenever old forms became
unwieldy or indadequate to express his ideas.  His readers however
have faced the double task of learning his new language and the new
structures they describe.  There has therefore arise a natural control:
a work of elaborate linguistic inventiveness and meager results will
not be widely read.
</p>

<p>
As the computer scientist represents and manipulates information
within a machine, he is simulating to some extent his own mental
processes.  He must, if he is to make substantial progress, have
linguistic constructs capable of communicating arbitrarily complicated
information structures and processes to his machine.  One might expect
the balance between linguistic elaboration and achieved results to be
operable.  Unfortunately, the computer scientist, before he can obtain
his results, must successfully teach his language to one particularly
recalcitrant reader: the computer itself.  This teaching task, called
compiler writing, has been formidable.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, the computing community has assembled, under the banner
of standardization, a considerable movement for the acceptance of a
few committee-defined languages for the statement of <i>all</i>
computer processes.  The twin ideals of a common language for
programmers and the immediate interchanibility of programs among
machines have largely failed to materialzie.  The main reason for the
failure is that programmers, like all scientists before them, have
never been wholy satisfied with their heritage of lingustic
constructs.  We hold that that demand for a fixed standard programming
language is the antithesis of a desire for progress in computer
science.  <i>That the major responsibility for computer language design
should rest with the language user will be our central theme.</i>
