<P>
    This is an answer to one of the regular expression exercises.
</P>

<P>
  The C comment, /*...*/ can be described by a regular expression. 
  Do so. 
  Prove that your solution describes all, and only, C comments. 
</P>

<H3>Answer by McKeeman</H3>
<P>
  <EM>From the C standard 6.4.9</EM>...Except within a character 
  constant, a string literal, or a comment, 
  the characters /* introduce a comment. 
  The contents of a comment are examined only to identify 
  multibyte characters and to find the characters */ that terminate it.
</P>
<P>
  One must be a bit of a C lawyer here. 
  /* introduce a comment. 
  OK, then I infer the /* are not part of the contents of the comment. 
  On the other hand, the terminating */ <EM>are</EM>&nbsp; a part 
  of the contents because they are found when examining the contents. 
  Because the definition would make no sense otherwise, 
  I also infer that there are no earlier terminating */ in the contents. 
  It is this sloppily worded definition which 
  we are asked to implement and prove. 
  We take advantage of the ill-definition by merely 
  requiring our proofs to be convincing.
</P>
<P>
  First, some simplifications. 
  The <TT>*</TT> in C gets tangled up with 
  the Kleene star of regular expressions 
  and except for <TT>/</TT> and <TT>*</TT>, 
  all the other characters in a C comment are equivalent. 
  Therefore we introduce a 3-element universe of 
  <PRE>
    <B>U:</B> / x .
  </PRE>
  where <TT>/</TT> stands for itself, <TT>x</TT> stands for the ASCII
  <TT>*</TT>, and <TT>.</TT> stands for all the other characters in C. 
  For example 
  <PRE>
    /x...x/
  </PRE>is a C comment in our artificial universe. 
  The rest of ASCII can now be used for regular expression meta characters.
</P>
<P>
  Suggestion 1 (by Doug McIlroy) 
<PRE>
  /x~(U*x/U*)x/
</PRE>
  This can be read as "a C comment is <TT>/x</TT> followed by anything 
  but a string that contains <TT>x/</TT>, followed by <TT>x/</TT>". This 
  suggestion not exactly an answer because "not such and such a string" is 
  not a regular expression. But it is elegant, obviously correct, and leads 
  to other solutions.
</P>

<P>
  Suggestion 2 (DFA)
</P>
<P>
  The spine of the diagram points down. The transitions on the right 
  point up. State 4 is final. The table of triples gives the same 
  information; it is actually a CFG for a DFA.
</P>
<PRE>
                                   go in see

   /|                               2  1 x

   x|                               2  2 .

    2 /| .|  |                      3  3 x
    +--+--+  |                      2  3 .
   x|       .|                      4  3 /
    +--+     |
    3 x|     |
    +--+-----+

    4
</PRE>
<P>
  One reads the diagram as "in state 0, if you see <TT>/</TT>, eat it and 
  transition to state 1..." This suggestion is not exactly an answer either 
  since a DFA is only equivalent to a regular expression.</P>
  <P>Suggestion 3 (regular grammar)</P>
  <P>Using the everyday notation for grammars, we can describe the DFA with 
  rules that have exactly 2 or zero symbols on the RHS. The rules can only 
  be applied to a string that already contains a nonterminal (e.g. a state). 
  So there is a special rule for 0 that is created out of nothing to get 
  things started.

</PRE>
<P>
  [Note to the student] Parse various candidates for comment and 
  non-comment to check the grammatical interpretation of regular 
  expressions. For example
</P>
<PRE>
/x/
/xx/
/x/x/
</PRE>
Here is the simplest parse: 
<PRE>
/xx/
0/xx/
1xx/
2x/
3/
4
</PRE>
<P>Suggestion 4 (back substitute and simplify the regular grammar)</P>
<P>
  Two everyday rules of the form 
<PRE>
n
  y
  n x
</PRE>
can be rewritten 
<PRE>
n
  y x*
</PRE>
Continuing in this way you get 
<PRE>
4
  /x(/|.|x+.)*x+/
</PRE>
<P>
  which, as it turns out, is the best known regular expression describing 
  C comments (first shown to me by Steve Johnson).
</P>
<P>
  So, what can be proven?
</P>
<P>
  Lemma: the strings described by regular expression 4 start with 
  <TT>/x</TT> and end with a different <TT>x/</TT> (eliminating bogus 
  solution /x/). This follows directly from the meaning of the regular 
  expression. 
</P>
<P>
  Lemma: the sequence <TT>x/</TT> never occurs in <TT>( / | . | x+ . )* </TT><BR>
  Proof: <TT>x</TT> is always followed by <TT>x</TT> or <TT>.</TT> 
</P>
<P>
  Lemma: the sequence <TT>x/</TT> occurs exactly once in the contents 
<PRE>
  ( / | . | x+ . )*  x+ /
</PRE>
  Proof: The end of the contents is <TT>( / | . ) x+ /</TT> and the 
  only place <TT>x</TT> precedes <TT>/</TT> is at the end.
</P>

<P>
  OK, we know that the /x and x/ behave. But are all legal comments 
  permitted? That is the implication of the McIlroy suggestion.
</P>
<P>
  Try induction. Consider the set of strings /x alpha x/ where alpha is 
  of length n. We can assume by induction that the set of strings alpha 
  contains every string of length n not containing the pair
</P>
<P>x/ 
</P>
<P>
  Extend each alpha by 
<P>. <BR>
</P>
<P>
  There are two cases: alpha ends in x or it does not. Assume not. 
  The extended string is recognized by the regular expression since one can 
  add dots one at a time until the final string of x-s. Assume so. Then 
  appending the dot creates a new x+. which moves inside the Kleene star. 
</P>
<P>
  So much for adding a dot. Now consider / and x. 
</P>
<P>
  Wasn't that fun?
